Code repository for NTNU Trondheim's iGEM18 team, Film Fighters.

Requirements:
Python 3.6.1 or later
Python Packages: NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib

Classes.py contains classes and update functions.
print_file.py contains print to file functions.
input_file.py contains input.
test.py contains test-programs. Run this file to test the code.

IMPORTANT: Before you run code, make a directory 'data' in the git folder.

The current implementation is slow. It's reccomended to decrease the size of the box or increase the time step 'dt' in the input_file.py
